The most common way you will hear metadata defined is, "data about data." More specifically, metadata is used to give data structure, add context, and facilitate resource discovery, organization, and identification. 

In the context of art and collection building we need to think about the details that describe a work of art. This descriptive metadata provides the audience, curator, web designer, etc. with valuable details that inform about the object.

Later in the semester we will be taking a look at the virual exhibit builder, Artsteps. Below is an example illustrating the difference between data and metadata and what type of metadata is important when building an exhibit with this tool.
