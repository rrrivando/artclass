Interdisciplinary art practice and exhibition is a valuable way to engage the viewer. Many artists choose to include text to enhance the visual, audio and/or other ways of experiencing their work. In modern exhibitions, experimentation should be encouraged with this textual component and Twine has the ability to create simple stories that are interactive and react to certain variables and conditional logic. This can be incorporated as a complimentary text tool in traditional spaces, in virtual environments, or stand alone as a tool for interactive creation.

The [Twine Cookbook](https://twinery.org/cookbook/) is an essential guide when starting to use Twine. 

Also take a look through [Twine Reference](https://twinery.org/reference/en/). It is a reference guide for the Twine editor and introduces the interface.
