####Visit [Artsteps.](www.artsteps.com) It's a great tool for creating your own virtual exhibitions. Through this software, students will be able to create a virtual gallery space and then upload images, audio, video and more. This includes the ability to create a walking tour of the space. This tool will be valuable for those who work with any medium and will allow them to share their work, preserve the layout, space, and curatorial decisions in a virtual setting that mimics traditional exhibits. For example, an artist could recreate a gallery they are preparing a proposal for and submit a virtual recreation of the space. Another example is the ability to collaborate with other artists around the world by curating and developing an exhibition that would otherwise be very costly and resource-heavy.
