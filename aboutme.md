My name is Ryan. I am a librarian at Eh University. I made this site for a studio art class to explore some DH tools while experimenting with creating digital exhibits. 

I am a big fan of, 

- Studio Ghibli films
- Peach season in Southern Ontario

The art students like, 

- Ambient music
- Being broke 

#### We hope you like the projects we eventually post here.
